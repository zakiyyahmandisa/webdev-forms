# webdev-forms
In this assignment, you’re going to build a mock contact form. Contact forms are a common interaction pattern and are a great way to practice your form making skills, as they usually include a variety of input fields, some of which are needed to submit, some of which aren’t. In this contact form, you’ll also include fields that are common in other types of forms, like checkboxes which are often used to agree to sign up for things, select boxes which are often used to choose one of many options (like reason for contacting, or categories), and radio buttons, which are used to choose one of a number of different options (similar to a select box, but often used when the differences require more explanation).

1. Create a new local project that uses Vite, Prettier, and ESLint
2. Build a content from that meets these requirements.
a. Accessible
b. Includes a name, email, and date field
c. Includes a large body input
d. Includes a select box
e. Includes at least one checkbox
f. Includes at least one set of radio buttons
g. Includes a submit button
h. Validates input using built-in validation as well as the Constraints Validation API
3. The email, body and checkbox inputs should be required.
4. Required field should have special styling to indicate they're invalid.
5. Invalid field should have special styling to indicate their invalid.
6. When a form is valid and is submitted, output what they've entered to the page.
7. The HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the web page should be separate files. Use JavaScript module syntax (ES Modules) for your JavaScript.
8. Submit your code by pushing it to GitHub, ensuring that there are no Prettier or ESLint errors.
